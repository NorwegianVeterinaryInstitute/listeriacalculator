# Listeria Calculator

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This calculator illustrates the storage conditions of salmon that result
in higher concentrations than 100 Listeria monocytogenes per gram of
sushi.

Enter time and temperature data for the steps from slaughter to finished
sushi that you have an overview of, and see how big an effect small and
large deviations correspond to. On the steps you do not have an overview
of, start with the data we have set up in the reference case.

The calculator is not a substitute for other requirements in the
regulations, only a supplement.
