### Background information
Listeria monocytogenes is a dangerous bacteria that is found in food from time to time. Normally healthy people can tolerate fairly high concentrations of it without getting seriously ill, but pregnant women, the elderly, small children and people with weakened immune systems can tolerate less. Read more about Listeria monocytogenes .

The regulations and Listeria monocytogenes in food
The regulations set a limit of a maximum of 100 listeria bacteria per gram in food to be eaten without heat treatment. This limit applies to all countries in Europe, and the limit applies throughout the entire storage period. Given that maintenance, it is enough to avoid serious illness in the vast majority of cases.

The challenge with Listeria is that it can grow in many types of food, even at refrigerated temperatures. If there is a break in the cooling chain, growth is faster than with good cooling, so the risk of high concentrations is greater.

Listeria is found relatively more often in fish and seafood than in other foods. This means that some countries advise pregnant women not to eat sushi. Other countries do not have categorical advice.

###This is how the calculation is done
We have measured how quickly Listeria grows in salmon and sushi at different temperatures, eg 4, 10 and 22 degrees. These are used as reference values ​​in the calculator. For other temperatures, a conversion model has been used to find the growth rate. This model is described in the guidelines for storage studies for risk assessment of Listeria in food.

We have checked that the model is valid for Listeria monocytogenes in salmon and salmon sushi for these temperature ranges:

for cold storage: -1 to +10 degrees
for storage outside the refrigerator, i.e. during processing: 4 to 25 degrees, limited to 8 hours
for tempering finished sushi 15 to 25 degrees
What is the starting concentration of Listeria in fish?
It is important to be aware that Listeria is usually not in fish, but it can happen that the bacteria is there. When that happens, the likely starting concentration is in the order of 1 listera bacterium per gram of fish if the producer has good control over production hygiene.

But it can happen that parts of the lot have up to 10 bacteria per gram, while other parts have no bacteria or only one listeria bacterium per 150 grams.

The reason for this variation is partly that Listeria is really unevenly distributed, and partly that the measurement methods used today are not accurate at such low concentrations.

Therefore, insert several starting concentrations and evaluate according to the worst likely scenario

###What is the final concentration of Listeria in fish?
Listeria multiplies by doubling. This means that the concentration increases as follows: 1-2-4-8-16-32-64-128-254-1008-2016-4032-8064-etc. When growth starts, it takes the same amount of time between each doubling, until there is no food or other conditions slow down growth. The time between each doubling depends on the temperature and the growth conditions in the food.

The growth curve for each link in the chain is given as lines in the figure, on a logarithmic scale. If one wants to recalculate in absolute numbers, it can be done by taking the exponent of the logarithm, like this:

Log 1 = 10(exp)1 = 10
Log 2 = 10(exp)2 = 100
Log 2,5 = 10(exp)2,5 = 316
Log 2,7 = 10(exp)2,7 = 501
Log 3 = 10(exp)3 = 1000
Log 5 = 10(exp)5 = 100000

What is the basis for limits for increasing the likelihood of illness
3 limit values ​​have been inserted in the figure. They represent

The limit value in the legislation, 100 Listeria per gram of food. (100= log 2)
The concentration of Listeria monocytogenes that increases the likelihood of illness in exposed consumers, i.e. pregnant women (fetuses), the elderly, young children and those with underlying illnesses. According to risk models, the risk for this group increases with 1,000 bacteria per gram, assuming a meal size of 50-100 grams. (1000 = log 3)
The concentration of Listeria monocytogenes that increases the likelihood of illness in normally healthy consumers. According to the same risk models and assumptions as above, the limit for this is 100,000 Listeria per gram. (100,000 = log 5)
Limits with the calculator
Even if the model and the calculator are tried and tested, a model is never more than a model. There are probably listeria strains that grow faster than those we have used when we have measured the growth rate. There is probably salmon that has a slightly higher pH than the one we have used, which can cause faster growth of Listeria than what we have measured. Some sushi has less acid than we have used, and will also give higher growth.

In addition: if temperature deviations have been measured in the cold room, it is likely that some parts of the room, for example close to the heating point, have a higher temperature than the rest. In that case, growth will be fastest in the warmest parts of the lot. The temperature in different parts of the refrigerator can also vary. Therefore, use the calculator based on a worst-case scenario.

###Legal
Veterinary institutes are not legally responsible for incorrect use of the calculator. The calculator must only be used as a supplement to other requirements in the regulations, not as a replacement.
