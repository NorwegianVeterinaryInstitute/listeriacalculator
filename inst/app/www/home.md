This is what the calculator does
This calculator illustrates the storage conditions of salmon that result in higher concentrations than 100 Listeria monocytogenes per gram of sushi.

Enter time and temperature data for the steps from slaughter to finished sushi that you have an overview of, and see how big an effect small and large deviations correspond to. On the steps you do not have an overview of, start with the data we have set up in the reference case.

The calculator is not a substitute for other requirements in the regulations, only a supplement.
