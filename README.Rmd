# Listeria Calculator

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is a R Shiny Golem app for calculating listeria growth in raw fish.

It is deployed to Posit Connect server from git using a `manifest.json` file.

Since the app is a package, the `manifest.json` has to capture it in the 
environment to be successfully deployed. Therefore before running the 
`rsconnect::writeManifest()` command in an R session, the package needs 
to be installed from Github with, for example: `remotes::install_github("NorwegianVeterinaryInstitute/listeriacalculator")`. 

The `manifest.json` has to be rebuild when a new dependency is added.

Refer to the function(s) documentations for the details about the modelling.
